this repository contains a bunch different small projects I have for the most part built except one heavily inspired by a stackoverflow question(duplicates_remover.py).At the time of writing
the repository contained three files a login page template,an autoclicker(useful in some games) and a duplicates remover which removes duplicates in a directory
